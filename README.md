# Analysis of Los Angeles Crime Data

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores crime patterns in Los Angeles by integrating crime data with information from businesses and schools. The goal is to identify high, medium, and low crime zones, analyze crime trends over time, and assess the impact on essential services and community well-being. The insights from this analysis aim to enhance security, guide safer living choices, and assist businesses in selecting optimal locations.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Acquisition**: Collects crime data from government open data sources.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures datasets, including handling missing values and geocoding locations.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover crime patterns.  
- **Visualization**: Uses Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau for data visualization.  
- **Machine Learning**: Implements K-Means clustering and Decision Tree classification to categorize neighborhoods based on crime levels.  

## **Datasets**  
- [City of Los Angeles - Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)  
- [City of Los Angeles - Listing of active businesses](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/listing-of-active-businesses)
- [County of Los Angeles open data](https://data.lacounty.gov/datasets/32331535785b405d869ca7a7aa3abb1f/explore)

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  


## **Key Insights**

- Crime rates influence business and school enrollments.  
- Most crimes occur between 4 PM - 6 PM.  
- K-Means clustering effectively categorizes neighborhoods by crime levels.
